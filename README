# smallblog

A small basic blog system.

By default it'll store information in PostgreSQL, so you'll need to have a
server running.  The schema is stored in data.clj, and you may need to modify
the connection strings (also in data.clj).


## Usage

By default, the server starts both Jetty and a NailGun server (for VimClojure).
It's pretty easy to disable NailGun, look at core.clj.  To start the server,
run:

	lein run :server
