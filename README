# smallblog

A small basic blog system.

By default it'll store information in PostgreSQL, so you'll need to have a
server running.  The schema is stored in data.clj, and you may need to modify
the connection strings (also in data.clj).

Copy src/smallblog/config.clj.template to src/smallblog/config.clj and change
the parameters to match your system.

If you want to use S3 to store images, you'll need to set your bucket
permissions (which you can do from the AWS web page, bucket properties -> Edit bucket policy.
A policy might look like this:

{
	"Version": "2008-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "AddPerm",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": {
				"AWS": "*"
			},
			"Action": "s3:GetObject",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::smallblog-test/*"
		}
	]
}



from a REPL, and it'll upload the policy to the bucket stored in *image-bucket*
specified in config.cfl.


## Usage

By default, the server starts both Jetty and a NailGun server (for VimClojure).
It's pretty easy to disable NailGun, look at core.clj.  To start the server,
run:

	lein run :server

Or, from a REPL (this won't block):

	(smallblog.core/start-server false)
